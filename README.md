**Allison T. || Underwriting Service Operations Vice President**
In a truly collaborative and innovative effort, Laura, Payten, and Katie worked together to create customized intake forms and a brand new [Power BI] dashboard to for MCE policy administrative work. This helps multiple Operations teams and Underwriting on greater transparency of processed work, where things are in the lifecycle of the policy and adherence to SLAs. It's been a resounding success for the groups that have seen it and are working within it and a great effort across the board. We appreciate the outstanding team work and dedication!

**Clint P. || Casualty & AWLS Service Operations Assistant Vice President**
Thank you so much for your support of the continuous improvement efforts within E&S Casualty Underwriting Service Operations. The speed along with attention to detail are truly world class. The Operations team would not be able to support the BU as efficiently as we do without the tools and resources you have built. Thank you!

**Payten H. || Senior Business Operations Analyst**
Thank you for all of your continued support with the requests for the Premium Audit Power BI. Your deep knowledge of the tool and problem solving skills allows for us to provide the customer detailed explanations as to why things are set up the way they are, allows us to determine the root causes, and allows us to make updates accordingly. Thank you for your time and willingness to always help out with this ongoing project!

**Tracy A. || Central Operations Assistant Vice President**
Laura, as I have been supporting the team over the past two weeks I reached out to you for help on several topics. Whether it was to assist with the CNR data issues, the urgent request from a senior leader or your stepping in to be a speaker at the recent All -Team meeting you rolled up your sleeves and provided support for each ask. I truly appreciate and applaud your teamwork!

**Jill I. || Underwriting Service Operations Director**
Laura’s contributions to this initiative were critical in bringing all the pieces together. A key component of our success was having a clear, accessible way to interpret the data generated from the QA workflow and SmartSheets reports. Laura’s expertise with Power BI enabled her to develop an outstanding QA scorecard that met this need. By enhancing the existing scorecard (much appreciated—especially having everything accessible via a single link), she incorporated the key details needed to help me, as a leader, gain a clearer understanding of performance trends, overall quality, and the areas where the team would most benefit from targeted coaching and support. Without Laura’s work, the data would remain fragmented and difficult to act upon. Her flexibility and patience throughout the process—particularly as we iterated on additional data points and refined the presentation—resulted in a highly effective, scalable tool that has the potential to benefit other business units as well.

Laura, just wanted to take a moment and thank you for all of the PowerBI help you have provided around all of the Quality Assurance work - Alt Markets, Producer Admin, Middle Markets and Motor Vehicle Services.

**Janice M. || Warranty and Lenders Solutions Assistant Vice President**
Thank you Laura for your time, dedication, talent and team effort in creating a tool that will be exponentially helpful to the AWLS Business unit. You have taken my ideas and given it life. You were very helpful in providing solutions that will be beneficial in ensuring we are innovative in our approach in driving business goals. The prioritization dashboard, along with the workflow and reporting features are beyond expectations. I look forward to creating additional reporting benefits for the Underwriting team as this is just the beginning of many drivers you will enable for AWLS. Bravo! Take a bow!!

**Clint P. || Casualty & AWLS Service Operations Assistant Vice President**
Payten and Laura - I can't describe how amazing it is that the two of you consistently deliver above and take us to the next level when asked to develop process improvement tools. Payten - you're understanding of workflow and Smartsheet capabilities continues to impress. In addition, the speed at which you can make these enhancements is mind-blowing. In some cases minutes! Laura - We couldn't deliver on the reporting that we do, without your PowerBI expertise. You're solution to automate the E&S Casualty tracking sheet is truly innovative! Thank you both!

**Jill I. || Underwriting Service Operations Director**
Laura, I cannot overstate how much of an impact and help your updated Renewal Solicitation automation will be for my team and for the business unit. You have saved both Ops and underwriting countless hours by taking us out of Excel/Teams and moving us into Smartsheets. Along the way you have asked great questions, anticipated needs that we hadn't even identified, and have been so patient as we sorted out exactly how we needed the new workflow to go. I am always grateful when I get to work with you. You are simply exceptional at this, and Arch is lucky you're here.

**Emily J. || Underwriting Service Team Lead**
Thank you for all of your support with developing and implementing the newly enhanced Casualty Smartsheet and PowerBI. This was a large project and your knowledge, patience and dedication made the transition smooth and successful. Thank you for continuing to support us as we have questions and suggestions. You are such a pleasure to work with. Thank you!

**June 2024**

**Jill I. || Underwriting Service Operations Director**
Laura, thank you so much for your continued help with the renewal solicitations update for EA, and the updates to the FPL scorecard (in addition to all of the other updates you handle). Your continuous focus on improvement and listening to the needs of the customers is stellar, and such a value to the company. I am so thankful for your help and patience!

**Nick S. || Submission Intake Operations Vice President**
Hey Laura. Thanks for all your work in building a new VMAC dashboard in Power BI, maintaining it and adding new tabs like the BOR status tab. Bryan Adams, SVP for Property Analytics provided feedback on the new version and was impressed by the simplicity and usability of the tool. You have also helped with repairing the Gateway server connection and kept the dashboard up, as its used 3 times a day plus monthly reporting, this tool is critical to the day to day operations of the Clearance team. Thanks for all your work on this!

**May 2024**

**Donna R. || Central Operations Assistant Vice President**
Laura, thank you again for coming up with, yet again, a way to save our team time and resources. The broker analysis you completed would have taken several man hours to complete! I truly appreciate your efforts!

**February 2024**

**Nick S. || Submission Intake Operations Vice President**
Thank you for all your work on the VMAC V2 clearance dashboard. Its a complex data set with technical issues to overcome, and I appreciate your efforts in solving each of the issues that have come up. The improved visuals and filters have increased the usability of the data for day-to-day tactical utilization for our huddles as well as supporting visual-data storytelling in monthly management reports to the Property BU. Overall, the V2 version is a vast improvement over what we had in the past. Great work!

**Amber V. || Central Operations Assistant Vice President**
I appreciate your consistent drive to learn more about PBI. Your expertise and skills really shine in everything you build.

Thank you for your team work and collaboration to help our team achieve the most beautiful visuals!

**Jill I. || Underwriting Service Operations Director**
Thank you so much for your work in creating the intake and visibility report for the ODEN requests for FPL.

I really appreciate it!

**December 2023**

**Jill I. || Underwriting Service Operations Director**
Thank you for your incredibly hard work in supporting FPL this year with the creation of the new SmartSheets workflow and scorecards. It is impossible to overstate how these updates have improved both the UA's day-to-day work, and my ability to report out accurate, easily viewable metrics. I know the road to getting those done was long and had many twists and turns, and you have been a delight to work with the entire time. I hope your holidays are full of rest and rejuvenation! Thank you!

**Carolyn H. || MVRs Business Operations Manager**
A shout out for all your work on the E&S & Retail Property Client Notification work. Thanks so much for your dependability and willingness to help whenever and wherever help is needed. Your efforts continually provide a great reflection on our team and is a great demonstration of the power of teamwork!

**Donna R. || Central Operations Assistant Vice President**
Laura, I wanted to take time to recognize your efforts last weeks as we worked through the issues with our Property Notices. Your prompt attention to updating our state logic rules allowed us to have a clear picture of workload, as well as, to prioritize the accounts that needed our immediate attention, which you handled, as well! None of this could not have been accomplished without you and I wanted you to know how appreciative I am of that!

**Payten H. || Senior Business Operations Analyst**
Thank you so much for taking over Smartsheet updates for Client Notifications while I was out of the office. With the high urgency of the items and the quick timeline needed for the project, I appreciate being able to rely on you to jump in when needed. THANK YOU!!

**November 2023**

**Payten H. || Senior Business Operations Analyst**
Thank you for helping with the creation of the UMUIM Power BI Monthly Report. Your experience and knowledge of Power BI has allowed us to create a report that will be a huge time saver every month. Thank you!

**Clint P. || Casualty & AWLS Service Operations Assistant Vice President**
Laura has done an amazing job learning how to utilize PowerBI to visualize data. She has even been certified by Microsoft! She leveraged that expertise to recognize a gap in helping the FPL Operations team understand where data is missing in the workflow. She developed a solution and thought through all of the details. The report she made provides an amazing view into where data is missing and who is responsible for the data. This view allows for stronger training as well as accountability into data quality. Improved data will give us stronger signals into what we are doing right and what we need to improve on. Thank you Laura!

**Jill I. || Underwriting Service Operations Director**
Thank you for all of your work on the Data Quality report. This report will be so helpful as we continue to work towards improving metrics and knowing which levers to pull when needed. Being able to do a weekly review and identify users who need support in the use of Smartsheet will be a very valuable tool for me. I appreciate your hard work and willingness to hop on the phone with me when I have questions. Thank you!

**October 2023**

**Amber V. || Central Operations Assistant Vice President**

Hi Laura, I wanted to thank you for taking time out of your day to walk through a PowerBI project with me. Not only did you find the solution for the data errors but you also walked me through how to set up a Date Table and answer any questions that I had. You are a PowerBI Wizard!
